finish db
refactor error code
refactor get field code
add all data types
errors only support xml or html, must be improved further on
  need error handler as advanced as routing
add try catch to ruby client when opening out file. if doesnt exist then test failed
real problem with lack of closure, like in database its impossible to call any method and
define alternate behavior. code ends up with lots of duplicated conditions

add all (app servers, roles, users, groups, hosts)
create a deployment script (readmes suck, ruby because its platform independent and already used
  in tests)
implements info studio flows - ability to start stop etc. resides in info.xqy just like db
